AntKeep is inspired heavily by Lemmings and Worms. The goal is to takeover a colony available on the game world before your opponent does!



The players will use pheromones to create trails for their drones, but will need to manage their drones with special ant types. These special ants are created from drones (the queen uses her own pheromones) which can they assign orders to drones **in their region of control**.



The actual game loop, balancing etc will. probably evolve with the project.

I think the game should be **REALTIME** but argue for otherwise. (potential for extra turn based layer could be interesting)
