# Working Titles: AntWars / Colony / Antz / AntFarm

## Summary
A "Lemmings Like" multiplayer arcade game with two teams of ants battling over a single colony. Each team will consist of Worker Ants (dumb, lemming like objects), and Solider Ants (given actions by player to control workers, attack enemy team). The main win condition will be to take over the level colony (probably using a "conquest" themed mechanic).  To provide level variety / strategy, objects will exists within the environment that can be used by players and neutral NPC's will roam the world attacking players workers.

## General Theme
Think Lemmings, Worms art style and humour. Easy to play / difficult to master, troll your friends.

## Modes
- Standard 1v1 multiplayer (MVP)
- VS AI (Probably need to bribe someone smarter than myself to code game AI)?

### Environments
- Outside Wilds
- Back gardens
- Kitchens!

### Objects


### NPC MOBS

Anteater: Because, obviously...
Cordiseps: Can introduce an "infection" mechanic, having to deal with infected workers / spores, or why not use your soldiers to force an infected ant into enemy territory as biological warfare
