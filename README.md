# AntKeeper!

So, I was watching The Last Of Us and thought how cordisepts could be the foundation of some pretty fun game mechanics...

Welcome to **AntKeeper**—a dark, strategic journey inspired by classics like *Dungeon Keeper*, but with a unique twist: **you’re not just managing an ant colony; you're a sentient spore of the *Cordyceps* fungus**! Your goal? **Infect, control, and conquer** the colony one ant at a time.

### Gameplay Overview
In **AntKeeper**, you start as a single spore with a simple mission: grow your influence by infecting individual ants and spreading through the colony. As your fungal network expands, you gain control over specialized ants with unique abilities to help the colony survive—and thrive—under your watchful, spore-driven guidance.

**One Spore to Rule Them All!**  
Our tagline is more than just a clever play on words. As you infect more ants, you build a network of influence over the colony, allowing you to direct their actions and unlock powerful abilities. But be careful—spread too quickly, and you might destabilize the colony before your fungal empire can take root.

### Ant Types and Their Roles

- **SoldierAnt** 🛡️  
  The muscle of the colony, **SoldierAnts** are the primary defense against predators and rival colonies. Once infected, they gain heightened aggression and defensive abilities to protect your growing empire.

- **EngiAnt** 🛠️  
  Responsible for **digging tunnels and constructing chambers**, **EngiAnts** are crucial for expanding the colony's reach. Infected EngiAnts dig faster and build sturdier structures, making them essential for spreading influence underground.

- **ScoutAnt** 🔍  
  These agile ants have enhanced **line of sight** and are skilled at **finding resources**. Infected ScoutAnts can explore further and detect hidden resources faster, ensuring the colony’s survival even in harsh environments.

- **SeptAnt** 🔮  
  The **SeptAnt** is a specialized caste that wields **spore-based abilities** to cast spells, disrupt enemies, or buff allies. As spell-casters, SeptAnts bring a new level of strategy to the game, allowing you to control the battlefield with a fungal touch.

### Current Development Status


**AntKeeper** is very much a work in progress. While the core mechanics are still being developed and refined, I am excited about where the game is heading! Primary focus right now is building out the infection mechanics, resource management, and ECS system. For now, enjoy watching ants...

**Mission 1** One spore into the breach (and yes, I patted myself on the back for that name) - Just what exactly is the goal here? No clue at this point but the eureka moment is so damn close I can taste it, a bit like [cake](https://github.com/fantakuchen)
